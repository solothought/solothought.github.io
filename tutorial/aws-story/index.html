                <p>Amir Wishu Sehgal, a 23-year-old with dreams as vast as the open sky, resided in a small flat on rent. This humble abode happened to be in the same building as Gurutaap’s shop. The building was nestled in a close-knit community where people may not have been wealthy in material possessions, but they possessed hearts filled with warmth and generosity. It was a place where neighbors knew each other by name, where doors were always open for a cup of tea and a friendly chat.</p>

<p>In this small but lively building, the residents formed a unique bond. They shared more than just walls; they shared their joys, sorrows, and even everyday items. It was a place where a cup of sugar or a carton of milk could be borrowed from a neighbor without a second thought. They believed in the power of community, supporting one another through thick and thin.</p>

<p>Amir, Gurutaap, and their neighbors were no strangers to the value of saving money. They understood the importance of stretching every penny and making the most of what they had. They would gather for potluck dinners, where each person contributed a dish, creating a feast that was shared by all. They organized small events and celebrations within the building, pooling their resources to create moments of joy and togetherness.</p>

<p>It was in this backdrop of camaraderie and resourcefulness that Amir’s idea of opening a cyber cafe took root. He saw an opportunity not only to fulfill his own dreams but also to uplift the community he held dear. Amir envisioned a place where neighbors could gather, connect with the world, and explore new horizons. He wanted to bring the marvels of the internet to their fingertips, creating a space that would inspire and empower.</p>

<p>As Amir shared his idea with Gurutaap, his eyes gleamed with excitement. Gurutaap, who had witnessed the strength of their community firsthand, immediately recognized the potential of Amir’s vision. He believed that this venture could not only uplift their own lives but also create opportunities for others in the neighborhood. Gurutaap saw the cyber cafe as a beacon of hope, a place where dreams could be nurtured and realized.</p>

<p>Anurag, who resided nearby and often found himself in need of a workspace outside of office hours, was drawn to Amir’s idea like a moth to a flame. He had experienced the struggle of finding a suitable place to work, brainstorm, and unleash his creativity. Anurag saw the cyber cafe as a haven where he and others could find solace, inspiration, and the tools needed to bring their ideas to life. He wholeheartedly supported Amir’s vision, recognizing the immense potential it held for their community.</p>

<p>With their shared dreams and determination, Amir, Gurutaap, and Anurag embarked on a journey that would shape not only their lives but also the lives of those around them.</p>

<div class="hr"><hr /></div>

<p>Once Amir, Gurutaap, and Anurag had successfully set up the cyber cafe, it quickly became a popular gathering spot for their friends and neighbors. In the evenings, it transformed into more than just a place for internet access; it became a hub of laughter and camaraderie. The friends would gather, sharing stories, making playful jokes, and creating memories that would be cherished for years to come. It was a testament to the strong bond they had formed, and the cyber cafe became the backdrop of their friendship.</p>

<p>Amir, always attentive to the needs and desires of the community, realized that there were opportunities to expand the services offered by the cyber cafe. He wanted to make it a one-stop destination for all their digital needs. With this vision in mind, he decided to introduce additional amenities to attract a wider audience.</p>

<p>Amir added a small section within the cyber cafe where people could purchase stationery items. He noticed that many of his customers, particularly students, required pens, notebooks, and other supplies for their academic pursuits. By providing these essentials, Amir not only met their needs but also increased the footfall at the cyber cafe. It became a convenient place where students could both study and access the internet, eliminating the need to travel to different locations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Amir recognized the growing popularity of digital payments and wanted to offer a seamless transaction experience for his customers. He introduced the option to receive payments through UPI (Unified Payments Interface), a convenient and secure method that allowed customers to pay for their services easily using their smartphones. This not only streamlined the payment process but also aligned the cyber cafe with the digital trends of the time.</p>

<p>As the cyber cafe gained popularity, Amir keenly observed the diverse needs of his customers. Some individuals frequented the cafe not only for internet access but also for gaming. They sought a space where they could immerse themselves in their favorite online games, competing with friends or exploring virtual worlds. Amir realized the potential in catering to this gaming community and decided to allocate a separate area with high-performance computers and gaming peripherals. This addition attracted a new segment of customers, further boosting the success of the cyber cafe.</p>

<p>Amir also noticed that many individuals, including freelancers and remote workers, required a dedicated space to carry out their professional tasks. Recognizing this need, he introduced a service where individuals could rent the computers and workspace on an hourly basis. This provided a flexible and cost-effective solution for those who required a workstation for freelance projects or other professional work.</p>

<p>With each new addition and service, the cyber cafe evolved into a thriving hub that catered to a wide range of needs. It became a place where students found resources, gamers indulged in their passion, and freelancers found a productive environment. Amir’s keen observation and willingness to adapt to the needs of the community ensured the continued growth and success of the cyber cafe.</p>

<div class="hr"><hr /></div>

<p>Amir had always been passionate about education and believed in the power of knowledge. He often found himself helping the children of his building with their studies, offering guidance and support whenever they needed it. He dedicated his free time to tutoring them, ensuring they had a strong foundation in their academics.</p>

<p>One fateful day, the exam results were scheduled to be announced. However, amidst the busyness of running the cyber cafe and attending to his customers, Amir completely missed the news. Little did he know that the children from his building had eagerly awaited their results and were planning a surprise visit to the cyber cafe.</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/images/posts/outside-cyber-cafe.webp" alt="kids waiting outside of the cafe for exam result generated by bing images" /></p>

<p>As the day unfolded, the children arrived at the cyber cafe, excitement radiating from their faces. They rushed in, hoping to check their results online. To their dismay, all the machines were occupied, and the atmosphere was bustling with customers engrossed in their own tasks. The kids looked at each other, disappointment creeping into their eyes.</p>

<p>Amir’s heart sank as he realized the chaos that had ensued. He felt a deep sense of regret for not being aware of the significance of the day and the impact it would have on the children. He understood their anticipation and could not bear to see them disheartened.</p>

<p>In a desperate attempt to rectify the situation, Amir approached his customers, explaining the predicament and requesting them to temporarily vacate their machines. He refunded their money in full, apologizing profusely for the inconvenience caused. While some customers were understanding and willingly obliged, others were reluctant to interrupt their work or leave their tasks unfinished.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges, Amir managed to secure a few machines for the children to check their results. The kids huddled around the screens, their eyes scanning the pages as they eagerly searched for their names. As the results flashed on the screens, their faces lit up with joy and relief. They celebrated their achievements, grateful for Amir’s efforts and the opportunity to share this moment together.</p>

<p>However, Amir couldn’t shake off the feeling of helplessness and the chaos that had unfolded. He realized that he needed a more efficient solution to cater to the needs of the community without disrupting the workflow of his customers. After much contemplation, he devised a plan to rent additional machines that could be easily returned on short notice.</p>

<p>Amir reached out to a computer rental service and arranged for a set of computers that could be borrowed as needed. This way, if a situation like the exam results arose again, he would have the flexibility to accommodate the children without causing inconvenience to his customers. The rental service agreed to the arrangement, understanding the unique needs of the community.</p>

<p>This decision proved to be a turning point for Amir, his business, and the community. The availability of additional machines on short notice brought a sense of relief and convenience to both the residents and customers of the cyber cafe. It created a harmonious balance where the needs of the community were met, while the business continued to thrive.</p>

<div class="hr"><hr /></div>

<p>While the arrangement with the computer rental service initially seemed like a viable solution, Amir soon encountered several challenges. Bringing the machines from another location took time, resulting in delays and inconvenience for the community. Additionally, setting up the machines temporarily in the cyber cafe required rearranging the space multiple times throughout the day, disrupting the flow of operations.</p>

<p>Realizing the limitations of relying on external rentals, Amir began exploring an in-house solution to address the issue. He brainstormed with his friend Gurutaap, who managed a neighboring shop. Together, they devised a plan to set up a small section within Gurutaap’s shop dedicated to computer workstations.</p>

<p>Amir and Gurutaap enlisted the help of some boys from Gurutaap’s shop, who were excited at the prospect of contributing to the community and being a part of this new venture. They rolled up their sleeves, enjoyed some tea and samosas, and set about creating a comfortable and efficient workspace. Laughter and friendly banter filled the air as they worked together, making the process enjoyable and lighthearted.</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/images/posts/worker-computer-network-aws.webp" alt="workers enjoying tea samosa in AWS cyber cafe" /></p>

<p>With the workspace set up, Amir and Gurutaap ensured that the necessary internet connectivity and equipment were in place. They collaborated to create a system where the community members could easily access the additional devices whenever needed. This in-house solution not only eliminated the delays and disruptions caused by external rentals but also fostered a stronger sense of ownership and control over the resources.</p>

<p>To further enhance the capabilities of the cyber cafe, Amir sought the assistance of his friend Anurag, who worked in a company that had surplus computer devices. These machines were not being utilized for an extended period, and Anurag saw an opportunity to contribute to the community and put the devices to good use.</p>

<p>Anurag facilitated the purchase of the extra devices from his office, ensuring that they were available for the community’s needs. This collaboration not only expanded the resources of the cyber cafe but also strengthened the bond between Amir, Anurag, and the community. Together, they were able to create a space that catered to the diverse needs of the residents, fostering an environment of growth, collaboration, and empowerment.</p>

<p>The in-house solution, coupled with the additional devices, brought immense benefits to the community, Amir, and his customers. The community members had easy access to the resources they needed, whether it was for educational purposes, gaming, or professional work. Amir saw the satisfaction and gratitude in the faces of the residents as they utilized the facilities, reinforcing his belief in the power of community and the impact of his endeavors.</p>

<p>To further optimize the resources of the cyber cafe, Amir decided to attach peripherals, such as keyboards, mice, and monitors, to the high-end devices in the cyber cafe. By doing so, he could utilize the spare capacity of these high-end devices when they were not being actively used by their primary users.</p>

<p>In simpler terms, let’s say there are some computers in the cyber cafe that have more power and capacity than what is typically required for everyday tasks like browsing the internet or using office applications. These computers are considered high-end devices. Instead of letting their power go to waste, Amir decided to connect additional peripherals to these high-end devices.</p>

<p>By attaching peripherals, Amir was able to create additional workstations that could be used by other customers. These workstations shared the power of the high-end devices, allowing multiple users to benefit from their spare capacity. For example, if a customer needed to use a computer for gaming or resource-intensive tasks, they could connect to one of these workstations and enjoy a high-performance experience.</p>

<p>This strategy not only maximized the utilization of the high-end devices but also provided a cost-effective solution. Instead of investing in separate computers with similar capabilities, Amir leveraged the existing resources and expanded the capacity of the cyber cafe. It enabled more customers to access powerful machines without the need for additional purchases or expenses.</p>

<p>By making efficient use of the spare capacity of high-end devices through the attachment of peripherals, Amir was able to cater to a wider range of customer needs. The customers benefited from the enhanced capabilities of the workstations, while the cyber cafe made the most of its resources. It was a win-win situation that optimized the usage of available technology and improved the overall experience for the community.</p>

<div class="hr"><hr /></div>

<p>Considering the need and to improve the communication, Amir thought to digitalize the daily gossip among the people of his building. he asked some of his customers if they can help him and took the guidance from Anurag.</p>

<p>The chat application that Amir and his team were testing had a special purpose. It was specifically designed for the people living in Amir’s building, including the residents and the community members. The unique thing about this chat application was that it could work without an internet connection. This means that even if there was no internet available or if there was a disruption in the internet service, the people in the building could still use the chat application to communicate with each other.</p>

<p>Gurutaap’s shop was the perfect location to have a machine connected to his cafe for this chat application. Despite the potential cost of extra wiring and setup, Gurutaap was always ready to experiment and try new things for the benefit of the people in his community. He understood the importance of having a reliable and accessible communication platform for the residents, especially in situations where the internet may not be available.</p>

<p>By having a machine in Gurutaap’s shop connected to the chat application, it created a hub for the people in the building to communicate and stay connected. They could go to Gurutaap’s shop, use the machine, and chat with their neighbors and friends without needing an internet connection. It provided a convenient and reliable way for the community members to stay in touch, share information, and support each other, even in times when the internet was not accessible.</p>

<p>This chat application, designed specifically for the community in Amir’s building, served as a safe and secure platform for communication. It allowed the residents to have private conversations with each other without the need to worry about their messages being seen by strangers or outsiders. It provided a sense of privacy and security, ensuring that the conversations within the community remained within the community.</p>

<p>By utilizing the chat application, the residents could easily coordinate events, share important announcements, ask for help, or simply have friendly conversations. It fostered a sense of unity and connectedness among the people in the building, creating a supportive and inclusive community environment.</p>

<p>Though the chat application could have been developed and tested from his cafe only, his idea to have another point in Gurutaap’s shop as intentional. He wanted his people to feel the joy, give the suggestions, and improve the application with their feedback. This also lead an idea that Amir can run delegate some of his work to Gurutaap’s shop. It was just the beginning of the extension of his cafe.</p>

<p>One day, a machine in his cyber cafe experienced a sudden failure, resulting in the loss of data for some customers including the code for chat application his team was writing. Amir was devastated by this incident and realized the need for a backup plan to prevent such data loss in the future. He was lucky to have another cop of code in the machine he setup on Gurutaap’s shop. But he couldn’t recover the data of other customer’s. It was not only the financial loss he bared but he also lost of the trust of many customers. He never wanted to let this incident happen again.</p>

<p>Amir understood the need for multiple machines in this scenario. Having all the machines in a single shop posed a risk. If any issue occurred, such as a power outage or hardware failure, it could disrupt the entire testing process of his chat application as well as other customer’s work, causing delays and inconvenience for the customer.</p>

<p>To mitigate this risk, Amir decided to utilize Gurutaap’s shop as a secondary location for the customer’s needs. Gurutaap had been facing financial difficulties with his current business and was eagerly looking for an opportunity to turn things around. This collaboration would benefit both Amir and Gurutaap, as it would bring in additional business for Gurutaap’s shop while ensuring the customer’s data was not hindered by any unforeseen incidents.</p>

<div class="hr"><hr /></div>

<p>Sangeeta is a resident of Amir’s building, living on the third floor while Amir resides on the fifth floor. She has long black hair, which flows gracefully down her back. Sangeeta is not just an acquaintance of Amir, but a good friend who often helps him with studying, planning, and organizing events in the building.</p>

<p>Like everyone else in the building, Sangeeta aspired to secure a good-paying job to support herself and contribute to the community. She had been preparing for a job interview for a long time, putting in hours of hard work and dedication. However, on the day of the interview, things did not go as expected. The weather took a turn for the worse, with rain pouring down heavily, causing traffic jams and making it difficult for Sangeeta to find an auto-rickshaw to commute to her interview location.</p>

<p>In the midst of the chaos, Sangeeta realized that reaching Amir’s shop, on the opposite side of the street, would not be possible due to the limited time she had. However, the additional setup in Gurutaap’s shop provided her with a glimmer of hope. It offered her an opportunity to face the interview remotely, without physically going to the office.</p>

<p>As soon as Amir, got wind of Sangeeta’s predicament, he rushed to the scene. The sight of a crowd gathered outside Gurutaap’s shop, “Guutaap Chai Paan,” caught his attention. Worry lines etched his face as he wondered how Sangeeta would manage to have her interview under such circumstances. Gurutaap, known for his curiosity and eagerness to help, looked on with a mix of curiosity and concern.</p>

<p>Inside the shop, Sangeeta sat nervously, her heart pounding with anticipation. She had a laptop in front of her, connected to the video chat. With every passing moment, her anxiety grew, unsure if this new setup would work seamlessly. However, as she finished her interview, a wave of happiness washed over her face. She emerged from the shop with a radiant smile, her worries replaced by relief and satisfaction.</p>

<p>The dramatic turn of events had led Sangeeta to face her interview in an unconventional yet successful manner. The additional setup in Gurutaap’s shop had provided her with the means to connect remotely, showcasing the power of technology and the resourcefulness of the community. Sangeeta’s triumph not only brought joy to her own face but also inspired those around her, reinforcing the belief in the strength of unity and the potential that lies within their community.</p>

<p>Although Amir hadn’t planned for the Gurutaap location intentionally, the incident of a machine failure had sparked the idea of utilizing multiple locations. Amir thanked his lucky stars for the machine failure that day. It not only led to the discovery of a solution that benefited the community, but it also helped Sangeeta in a crucial moment, showcasing the positive impact of Amir’s work.</p>

<p>This incident inspired Sangeeta, as she witnessed firsthand how Amir’s dedication to providing reliable and accessible technology made a difference in people’s lives. She was grateful for the distributed setup and recognized the value it brought to the community. This experience motivated her to explore ways to contribute to the community herself, realizing the potential of technology in creating opportunities and overcoming challenges.</p>

</p>

<p>Though the story doesn’t end here, I would like to feel this mesmerizing moment where the raindrops continued to fall, but they were no longer a hindrance. They became a backdrop to the triumph and resilience of Sangeeta. This moment was filled with an overwhelming sense of joy, as the sound of laughter and the warmth of hugs filled the air. It was a moment that would forever be etched in their memories and mine too. Each drop landing softly on Sangeeta’s face, a delicate dance between the raindrops and her tears. The wetness mingled together, as if the rain itself was joining her in her emotional journey. But amidst the rain-soaked chaos, a glimmer of happiness flickered in Sangeeta’s eyes, a spark of triumph that couldn’t be extinguished. Amidst the downpour, Amir stood on the opposite side of the shop, pushed back by the crowd. Happiness on his face with a big smile over the worry and anticipation he had.</p>

<p>Let’s meet in the next part of this story.</p>
