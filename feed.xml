        <title>Amir Wishu Sehgal cafe: The story of opportunities</title>
        <description>Amir Wishu Sehgal, a 23-year-old with dreams as vast as the open sky, resided in a small flat on rent. This humble abode happened to be in the same building as Gurutaap’s shop. The building was nestled in a close-knit community where people may not have been wealthy in material possessions, but they possessed hearts filled with warmth and generosity. It was a place where neighbors knew each other by name, where doors were always open for a cup of tea and a friendly chat.
