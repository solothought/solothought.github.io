    "title": "9 Easy steps to Setup EC2 instance",
    "body": "2023/07/03 - In this article, we’re going to create an EC2 instance inside a subnet inside a VPC inside a availability zone inside a region inside AWS. AWS [ Region [ AZ [ VPC [ Subnet [ EC2 ] ] ] ] ] BasicsBefore we start, let’s understand some very minimum terminologies to understand some AWS jargon in easy language.  EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud. This is a service that provides virtual machines that you can use to run your applications.      AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template that contains the software configuration (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications) for an EC2 instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI.    An instance type is a type of EC2 instance that has a specific set of hardware specifications, such as the number of CPU cores, the amount of memory, and the storage capacity. Eg General Purpose, Compute/Memory/Storage/GPU Optimized. (Eg T2 micro, T2 small, etc. )    VPC: Virtual Private Cloud. This is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch your EC2 instances.  Subnet: A logical division of a VPC. Subnets can be used to group EC2 instances together based on their function or security requirements. A range of IP address will be reserved for this subnet. An EC2 instance will be assigned to some IP address from this range.  Security group (SG): A set of rules that control inbound and outbound traffic for your EC2 instances. Security groups can be used to control who can access your EC2 instances and what resources they can access.  IAM roles: Permissions that can be assigned to EC2 instances. IAM roles allow you to grant permissions to EC2 instances without having to manually configure the permissions on each instance.  Key pair: A set of public and private keys that can be used to authenticate to your EC2 instances. Key pairs are used when you connect to your EC2 instances using SSH.  EBS: Elastic Block Store. This is a storage service that provides persistent block storage volumes for your EC2 instances. EBS volumes can be used to store data that needs to be kept persistent, even if your EC2 instance is terminated.  EFS: Elastic File System. This is a file storage service that provides scalable, highly available, and durable file storage for your EC2 instances. EFS can be used to share files between EC2 instances, and it can also be used to store data that needs to be accessed by multiple users or applications. SetupPrerequisite: I’m expecting that following are already setup;  AWS account VPC Subnet IAM Role Security GroupSteps: It is in summary what you’ve to do. Refer the quick reference image to visualize and understand it properly.  Login to EC2 Dashboard: AWS account &gt; AWS Services tab &gt; Select “Compute” { list of service } Select AWS Region &gt; Launch Instance Select AMI(Image): Set of OS, Software, libraries etc (just like VM image, Docker image, or ISO image) Choose Instance Type: Select the hardware capacity for your virtual machine.  Configure instance details     No. of instances: you can provision up to 20 instances at a time.    Purchase Options: Request Spot Instances? Yes/No   Networking details: In which VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) you want to launch your instance and under which subnets inside your VPC. AWS will assign a dynamic IP to it from their pool of IPs once the instance is launched.          VPC,     Subnet,     Auto assign Pubic IP? Yes/NoAuto assigned public IP can be changed when an instance restarts (shutdown -&gt; starts). To assign a static IP check appendix.           IAM Role: Access permissions   Shutdown Behaviour: Stop or Terminate         Enable termination protection: In case, you have accidentally terminated your instance, AWS has a layer of security mechanism. It will not delete your instance if you have enabled accidental termination protection.           Under Monitoring: you can enable Detailed Monitoring if your instance is a business critical instance. Basic monitoring is free of cost.    Under Tenancy: If your application is a highly secure application, then you should go for dedicated capacity otherwise shared tenancy.     Add Storage: AWS provides 3 types of EBS volumes- Magnetic, General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPs.  Tag Instance: To find an instance easily Create/Select Security Group (SG): Consider it as firewall to control incoming and outgoing connections/traffic. In this article, I consider that SG is already created.  Add SSH keys: To access the virtual machine from terminal. Download the keys and add them to your login software or OS. To see all launched instances: AWS account &gt; “Instances” from left panel AppendixStatic IP address: This is an optional step Need: To assign a static IP address to a EC2 instance or VPC so that it is not changed when your virtual machine starts again.  Steps  Login to EIP Dashboard: AWS account &gt; “Elastic IPs” from left panel Create a Static IP Address: Allocate New Address &gt; VPC/EC2 Bind address to an EC2: Select already created IP address &gt; “Actions” menu &gt; “Associate Address” &gt; Search for your instance &gt; “Associate”You can check the associated EIP from Instances dashboard.  ✔️ Tip  From the “Actions” menu of EIP dashboard, you can release or delete previous address to reduce cost. Login to EC2 instance: You can check the status, and the configuration of EC2 instance from EC2 dashboard. 1ssh -i /path/key-pair-name. pem instance-user-name@instance-public-dns-name instance-public-dns-name: Use the IP address of your machine to connect.  You must have already downloaded the SSH keys during the instance creation. Setup them to the software or OS you’ll be using for login.  Open the port for SSH connection in security group. You can optionally add the IP address of the machine you’ll be accessing the EC2 instance from.  There is a default user name based on the AMI you used. Once you login with default user name, you can create more users for safety reasons. Default Users       AMI   user name         Amazon Linux 2023, Amazon Linux 2, or the Amazon Linux AMI   ec2-user       CentOS AMI   centos or ec2-user       Debian AMI   admin       Fedora AMI   fedora or ec2-user       RHEL AMI   ec2-user or root       SUSE AMI   ec2-user or root       Ubuntu AMI   ubuntu       Oracle AMI   ec2-user       Bitnami AMI   bitnami   Otherwise, check with the AMI provider.  ✔️ Tip  Avoid using the default user &amp; SSH keys if there are multiple users. For this, Create key pair &gt; import the public key to EC2 instance &gt; share private key with other users Snapshot: Amazon provided AMIs are a standard set of software and OS which can’t be modified. Consider them like a docker image. We can create an instance from them just like we create docker container.  What if we change anything in the instance and restart it? The changes will be lost. Every time, we restart an instance, it starts from a base image from scratch. To persist the changes, you can take the snapshot. You can either take the snapshot of complete EC2 instance which includes OS, applications and data or just the volume that include only data. If you take the snapshot of an instance, you can use it to create an AMI. You need not to stop the instance to take it’s snapshot. To take the snapshot of a volume, you must stop the running instance first. For a good practice, you should remove temp folder, cache, logs, or any temporary data before taking snapshot of an instance. So the size of the image is lesser. I tried to cover all the basic details you need to understand and setup EC2 instances. In the next article, we’ll see how to manage an EC2 instance. "

    "body": "2023/06/29 - The Java valley is always under the threat. So all the masters must be prepared all the time. It wasn’t solely Po’s unwavering determination that led to Master Shifu’s decision to anoint him as the master. Astonishingly, Master Oogway had perceived something extraordinary in Po, a hidden secret concealed within a chest safeguarded in the enigmatic depths of the Temple’s secret chamber. The chamber itself remained a clandestine sanctuary, known only to Master Shifu, shrouded in mystery and concealed from the prying eyes of any other master. In the mystical land of Java Valley, there was a grand gathering of martial artists from different clans. Each clan had its own unique set of skills and techniques. The gathering was organized by the Java Clan, known for their mastery of nested classes and nested interfaces. The Java Clan believed in the power of encapsulation and wanted to organize their skills in a hierarchical manner. They used nested classes and nested interfaces to achieve this goal. The nested classes represented different levels of mastery within the clan, while the nested interfaces represented specific skill sets. Within the Java Clan, there was a class called GrandMaster. This class served as the outer class and contained several nested classes and nested interfaces. Each nested class represented a different level of mastery, from Novice to Master, while each nested interface represented a specific skill, such as Swordsmanship or Meditation. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526class GrandMaster {  // Nested class representing Novice level  class Novice {    // Novice level skills and techniques  }    // Nested class representing Apprentice level  class Apprentice {    // Apprentice level skills and techniques  }    // Nested class representing Master level  class Master {    // Master level skills and techniques  }    // Nested interface representing Swordsmanship skill  interface Swordsmanship {    // Swordsmanship techniques  }    // Nested interface representing Meditation skill  interface Meditation {    // Meditation techniques  }}The Novice, Apprentice, and Master classes represented different levels of mastery within the Java Clan. Each class had its own set of skills and techniques that were taught to the members of the clan at that particular level. The Swordsmanship and Meditation interfaces represented specific skills that were highly valued within the Java Clan. These interfaces defined the techniques and methods that needed to be mastered in order to become a true warrior of the Java Clan. By incorporating the Meditation interface, the Java Clan emphasizes the importance of mental well-being and the benefits it brings to their martial arts practice. 123class Warrior implements GrandMaster. Swordsmanship, GrandMaster. Meditation {  // Implement Swordsmanship and Meditation techniques}Warriors of the Java Clan, such as the Warrior class, could implement these nested interfaces to showcase their proficiency in specific skills. By implementing these interfaces, the Warrior class gained access to the techniques and methods defined within the interfaces. The use of nested classes and nested interfaces allowed the Java Clan to organize their skills and techniques in a structured and hierarchical manner. It provided clarity and encapsulation, ensuring that each level of mastery and each skill set had its own dedicated space within the clan. In conclusion, the Java Clan utilized nested classes and nested interfaces to organize their skills and techniques in a hierarchical manner. The nested classes represented different levels of mastery, while the nested interfaces represented specific skill sets. This organizational structure allowed the clan members to showcase their proficiency in different skills and techniques, ultimately making them formidable warriors in the land of Java Valley. The nested interfaces Swordsmanship and Meditation allowed the Java Clan to define specific skill sets within their martial arts practice. By nesting these interfaces within the GrandMaster class, the Java Clan could group related interfaces and limit their scope to the context of the GrandMaster class. This ensured that these skills were encapsulated within the martial arts practice of the Java Clan and provided a clear contract for future warriors to implement and master these skills.   📌 Info  You know a class or an interface can be created inside a method too. EnumEnums can be used to represent the different ranks, directions, or even the emotions experienced by the warriors during their journey. For example, the Java Clan could use an enum to represent the different directions, such as NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST, which could be used to navigate through the martial arts techniques and strategies. By using enums, the Java Clan can ensure that the values of these essential aspects of their martial arts practice are fixed and cannot be changed. This provides a clear and consistent way to represent these values throughout the decision making process and discussions. New warriors undergo hard training sessions. During these training sessions, different emotions can arise, and the Java Clan wants to handle each emotion differently.  12345678910111213141516171819202122232425public enum Emotion {  CALM {    @Override    public void handleSituation() {      // Handle situation for calm emotion      System. out. println( Stay focused and maintain inner peace.  );    }  },  ANGRY {    @Override    public void handleSituation() {      // Handle situation for angry emotion      System. out. println( Channel your anger into controlled power.  );    }  },  PEACEFUL {    @Override    public void handleSituation() {      // Handle situation for peaceful emotion      System. out. println( Embrace the serenity and harmonize your movements.  );    }  };  public abstract void handleSituation();}During the hard training sessions, the Java Clan can invoke the handleSituation() method based on the emotion experienced by the new warriors. It helps to examine if a warrior is ready for the next phase. Be Anonymous 📌 Info  Anonymous classes in Java are a specific type of nested class. They are defined without a name and can be created inside another class or interface. Anonymous classes often extend subclasses or implement interfaces. In the Java Clan, there exists a Warrior Pool, which holds the responsibility of providing warriors for battle. However, creating an instance of a warrior is not an easy task and can consume a significant amount of time, which is not affordable during war. To address this challenge, a separate community called the Warrior Pool was created to manage the pre-existing images provided by each master. Before handing over a warrior to the villagers for combat, the Warrior Pool employs a special technique to sanitize all the images, ensuring they are safe and free from any potential vulnerabilities. To standardize the sanitation process, a separate entity called SecretsSanitizer was established. The Warrior Pool community opted for an anonymous approach to apply the standard sanitation process with their own logic. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627public interface SecretsSanitizer {  default Warrior sanitize(Warrior warrior){    return warrior;  }}public class WarriorPool {  public Warrior giveWarrior() {    // Take warrior image from the available pool    SecretsSanitizer secretsSanitizer = new SecretsSanitizer() {      @Override      public Warrior sanitize(Warrior warrior) {        // Remove any manuscript        // Remove the knowledge about the secret chamber        return warrior;      }    };    Warrior warrior = // Retrieve warrior from the pool    // Sanitize the warrior before giving it to the villagers    Warrior sanitizedWarrior = secretsSanitizer. sanitize(warrior);    return sanitizedWarrior;  }}Over time, they realized the need to make the process more generic and designated a separate entity responsible for sanitizing the secrets. This shift allowed the Warrior Pool to focus more on the pooling process and invoke various types of sanitizers without requiring knowledge of their specific workings. As part of their improvement efforts, the Warrior Pool also decided to shift the sanitation process to occur when an image is assigned to the pool, rather than when it is required. This change aimed to increase availability and streamline the overall workflow. There were still many places where anonymous practice of creating classes were being used. For example; Java Clan wants to handle the situation when a warrior is feeling overwhelmed during training. 1234567Emotion. OVERWHELMED {  @Override  public void handleSituation() {    // Handle situation for overwhelmed emotion    System. out. println( Take a moment to breathe and regain focus.  );  }}. handleSituation();If you don’t know, anonymous classes are useful in situations where you need to create a class that has a specific implementation for a single-use scenario. They are commonly used when you need to override a method or provide a unique implementation for a particular behavior or to introduce additional methods or fields within the context of the anonymous class.  If you need to create multiple instances of a class or require access to its constructor, a local class might be more appropriate You can freely create a local class for the same functionality. But as Java suggest to maintain the correct hierarchy and encapsulation, a local class which have no other use than to be used in a method for single time purpose, can be created as anonymous class. Once, you realize that the functionality you implemented in anonymous class can be reused on different places then you can separate the code and make a local class. Be GenericPo was given the responsibility to manage the library. The library that Po was entrusted with was a grand structure nestled in the heart of the village. Its towering walls were adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes of ancient battles and wise sages imparting their knowledge. The entrance, guarded by stone lions, led to a vast hall filled with shelves upon shelves of books, scrolls, and manuscripts. At the heart of the library lay the restricted section, a chamber shrouded in an air of mystery. Here, the most treasured and delicate scrolls were kept, representing the ancient martial arts techniques that had been passed down through generations. The room was dimly lit, with soft rays of sunlight filtering through stained glass windows, casting colorful patterns on the polished wooden floors. It was within this sacred space that Po’s friends, the village warriors and scholars, gathered to discuss their dreams and aspirations. They saw in Po a kindred spirit, someone with a passion for knowledge and a burning desire to leave his mark on the world. Encouraged by their unwavering support, they convinced Po that he had the potential to become a great master by contributing his own literature to the library.  With their words echoing in his mind, Po felt a surge of determination coursing through his veins. He imagined himself standing amongst the ancient scrolls, sharing his wisdom and insights with future generations. The thought of leaving a lasting legacy, a testament to his growth and understanding, inspired him to embark on this ambitious journey. But the road to becoming a great master was not without its challenges. Doubts crept into Po’s mind, whispering tales of inadequacy and fear of failure. It was during these moments of uncertainty that his friends became his pillars of support, reminding him of his unique perspective and the value he could bring to the library. One day, after hours of contemplation, Po’s mind was buzzing with excitement. He had come up with a brilliant idea to contribute to the library. Determined to make it a reality, he woke up early in the morning, the sun barely peeking over the horizon. The village was still shrouded in a hazy mist, and the air was filled with the aroma of freshly brewed tea. Po quietly slipped out of his bed, careful not to disturb his sleeping companions. With a sense of purpose in his heart, he made his way to his father’s noodle shop. The door creaked open, and Po found his father, Mr. Ping, already hard at work, kneading the dough and preparing the ingredients for the day’s noodles.  As Po approached his father, a mischievous glimmer danced in his eyes. He knew that convincing Mr. Ping to share the secret recipe of his famous noodles would not be an easy task. Po rolled up his sleeves and jumped into action, offering his assistance in any way he could. With each chop of vegetables and stir of the simmering broth, Po’s determination grew stronger. The villagers, still rubbing the sleep from their eyes, began to notice Po’s unusual behavior. Whispers spread through the village as they wondered why the young panda was so eager to help his father. Some speculated that he had stumbled upon a hidden treasure, while others believed he had fallen in love with a mysterious stranger. The curiosity surrounding Po’s early morning activities added an extra layer of intrigue to the tale. Day after day, Po continued to wake up early, working side by side with his father. The villagers couldn’t help but be captivated by the dedication and passion that emanated from the noodle shop. They marveled at the aroma of the noodles that wafted through the air, tempting their taste buds and drawing them closer to the shop. As Po’s relationship with his father blossomed, so did his understanding of the secret recipe. Mr. Ping, impressed by his son’s unwavering commitment, decided it was time to pass down the closely guarded knowledge. Together, they perfected the art of noodle-making, infusing each strand with love, tradition, and a touch of magic. With the secret recipe in his possession, Po felt a surge of confidence as he embarked on his journey to the library. Little did he know that his adventure was about to take an unexpected turn. Time was passing quickly, and it was Po’s last day in the library. He hastily wrote down the secret noodle recipe and rushed to the library to submit his scroll before closing time. Master Shifu, the wise guardian of the library, had a keen eye for detail and was quick to spot any inconsistencies. When Po presented his scroll to Master Shifu, the atmosphere was charged with anticipation. The room fell silent as Master Shifu unrolled the scroll, his eyes scanning the words and illustrations. Suddenly, a look of surprise crossed his face, followed by a burst of laughter. The scroll was filled with comical errors and nonsensical martial arts techniques. Po’s cheeks flushed with embarrassment as he realized his mistake. He had been so focused on the excitement of contributing to the library that he had neglected to understand the concept of type safety. He approached Master Shifu in a mild voice and asked what type safety meant. Master Shifu, though initially amused, took this opportunity to teach Po a valuable lesson. Master Shifu calmed down and gathered all the masters in the classroom. Master Shifu showed a toy with holes of different shapes on the top: square, circle, and triangle. In his other hand, he held wooden shapes. He explained to all the masters, “Even though each shape is meant to be passed through a specific hole, they can be inserted into the box through the circle hole due to improper type checking. ” 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950import java. util.

He drew a metaphor, comparing the concept to a quiver filled with arrows. “In this palace, type safety is like a vigilant archer ensuring that the right arrows are used in the right situations,” he explained, his voice resonating with wisdom. Referring to the incident of the scroll type mismatch indirectly, Master Shifu delved into a detailed explanation of type safety. To illustrate his point, he reached into the quiver and retrieved an arrow, holding it up for everyone to see. “Each arrow is meticulously crafted for a specific purpose, be it to strike with precision or to create a non-lethal impact,” he began.  He then showcased another arrow, explaining its unique properties. “This arrow is coated with chemicals that ignite upon reaching the peak of its trajectory, generating intense heat,” he described. “And this arrow, with a hammerhead, is designed to repel enemies without causing harm. Each arrow requires a distinct bow, crafted specifically for its purpose. ” Master Shifu emphasized the significance of ensuring type safety in weaponry, drawing a parallel to the need for proper usage of programming constructs. “Just as a bow must be matched with the appropriate arrow, it is essential to maintain type safety in programming, ensuring that each component is correctly utilized at the right time,” he concluded, leaving a lasting impression on Po and his fellow learners. The metaphor of arrows and bows served as a vivid representation of the consequences that could arise from neglecting type safety. It conveyed the importance of understanding and adhering to the principles of type safety, protecting against potential errors and ensuring the smooth functioning of programs, just as the archer safeguards the integrity of their arsenal.  📌 Info  The JRE leverages type safety for performance optimizations by eliminating unnecessary type checks during runtime. What do you think? Am I talking about Po or Tigress or someone new? 	     Master Shifu is teaching a secret martial skill to ___. Through rigorous training and discipline, __ will master this technique and become a formidable warrior. With __ dedication and determination, success is inevitable.   Actually it doesn’t matter if you fill in “Po” or “Tigress” in all three blanks, the sentence will still make sense. Using Po: Master Shifu is teaching a secret martial skill to Po. Through rigorous training and discipline, Po will master this technique and become a formidable warrior. With Po’s dedication and determination, success is inevitable. Using Tigress: Master Shifu is teaching a secret martial skill to Tigress. Through rigorous training and discipline, Tigress will master this technique and become a formidable warrior. With Tigress’s dedication and determination, success is inevitable. This is how Generics work. For an example, consider a cross training module where a master can teach other master with his skills. 123456789101112131415class Trainer&lt;T extends Master&gt; {  private List&lt;T&gt; trainers;  public void addTrainer(T trainer) {    trainers. add(trainer);  }  public void train(T master) {    // Training logic goes here    System. out. println( Training   + master. getClass(). getSimpleName());    for (T trainer : trainers) {      System. out. println( Trained by   + trainer. getClass(). getSimpleName());    }  }}Now suppose I want to ensure that Po and Tigress can teach each other. Master Shifu can teach both but they’re not teaching Master Shifu; 12345for (T trainer : trainers) {	if (!trainer. getClass(). isAssignableFrom(master. getClass())) {		System. out. println( Trained by   + trainer. getClass(). getSimpleName());	}}All the masters must be ready for the battle, and it can happen only when all help each other. Some generic weapons and generic strategy might be useful in the battle field. Hope! we’ll win the battle. I tried to cover the concepts or rather need of nested classes, Enum, anonymous classes, and generics through the story of KungFu Java. Some of the topics may need more depth to understand their use. However, I was more focused to explain their need. This article is basically for absolute beginners or for entertainment purpose. "

    "title": "Story of Kungfu Java Valley - Explanation",
    "body": "2023/06/27 - In the last article, The story of Kungfu Java Valley , we read about Java Valley and how Po became Master Po. There were many Java concepts we already read in that article. In this article, we’ll focus more on the technical side and reveal remaining hidden Java concepts. I’ll extend the story in the next article to understand more concepts. I hope you’ll enjoy it. Abstract Class: Master Oogway – the wise old turtle, is an abstract class who has an abstract method fight. Every master has to find their techniques to fight. In Java, an abstract method needs to be implemented compulsorily by the sub-classes (notice that I didn’t use the word “child” for sub-class). If a sub-class doesn’t want to implement an abstract method, it can also declare the method as abstract so it’s sub-classes can implement them. But in this case, it also needs to be abstract. Instance reference: Though Master Oogway wants their type to develop fighting skill, he never fights himself. Hence, no one can request him to create his images or instances (you can consider it a child). This is the same as we can’t instantiate an abstract class in Java. However, a newly trained master may take the reference of his master or master of master for initial fightings until he gains some confidence. 1Oogway ninjaTurtle = new Po(); //Referenced by master classThis is not only to gain confidence, but it’s always good if the master is used as a reference and use the skills of any student as per need. Eg Po can use his skills to defeat the enemy and Tigress can use her skills. But Master Shifu can use skills of both; 12Shifu fighter = new Po();Po fighter = new Shifu(); //Not allowed 📌 Info  A student can’t be a reference for his master When we write a post on a blog, we define categories and tags. These are the markers to group particular type of posts. Though they define the type of post, they are still marker not the class. A post is a type of blog-page. A blog-page can be a type of web-page and so on.  📌 Info  I use “marker” in most of the places in this article to “Interface”. Interface: A marker can have some default implementation of instructions to reduce the work overload on new Masters or masters with different skill. For example, some masters are the warrior but some are the teacher of secret skills. There are people in the temple who are not even the master but they help to manage other work of the temple. Sometimes, in their absence, suppose an invigilator, a master who is marked as an invigilator as well, can give extra hands if available. These masters need not to be specialized and can cope with default skills already defined by Marker. Same as Java interface may have a default implementation of a method.  The person who is in-charge of villager training might be surprised when he saw a warrior image (or instance) to perform the duty of invigilator. Without going in the complexity of a warrior, the in-charge person can use the expected skill of invigilator given by the Marker. But this is possible only if this skill is public. Hence, Java interface methods are supposed to be public. The all other methods which are private are just the supporter methods for default implementation. 123456789101112interface Invigilator {  private void checkId() {}  private void checkAttendance() {}  default void startExam() {    checkId();    checkAttendance();    System. out. println( Starting exam. . .  );  }}:Invigilator nonExperinced = new Tigress(); // Tigress implements Invigilator Interface vs Abstract class: This is worth noticing that Oogway represents a class of his own type. Since he is abstract, he can instruct his types (sub-classes) to implement some mandatory skills just like a Marker (or Interface) does. But if he will provide the default implementation of the mandatory skill then the other master may ignore the importance of the mandatory skill they should develop. Hence, in Java, markers support default implementation for a method a class should implement but an abstract class doesn’t. However, there can be some skills a master class has and a type class can override it. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031abstract class Oogway {  public void reducePressure(){    System. out. println( Meditate );  }}class Shifu extends Oogway {  public void reducePressure(){    System. out. println( Balance on toe );  }}class Po extends Shifu {  public void reducePressure(){    System. out. println( Eat momos!! );  }}public class Main {  public static void main(String[] args) {    Oogway firstTimeFighter = new Po();    firstTimeFighter. reducePressure(); //  Eat momos!!         Shifu secondTimeFighter = new Po();    secondTimeFighter. reducePressure(); //  Eat momos!!         Shifu experiencedFighter = new Shifu();    experiencedFighter. reducePressure(); //  Balance on toe   }}It’s obvious that some of the villagers are confused between the importance of being abstract or marker. Are you one of the villagers!? 😂 Let me take a chance to clear up that confusion. A marker (or interface) can be considered a lightweight abstract solution. An image of some master can play multiple roles due to the markers. Since a marker is a light-weight solution, it can’t be instantiated but can be used as reference purposes only. Since they can’t be instantiated, they can’t have instance variables and the variables they have are supposed to be public, static and final. Because without public, they can’t be used. Without static, they can’t be used as no instance. Without final, their state can be changed but the state will be changed which can cause inconsistency. So an interface creates very less memory footprint. Note that the methods implemented in an interface can create instance variables.  Using public, static, final keywords with the variable in an Interface is optional. The importance of abstract class: A master with a marker seems similar to an abstract master. But there are some meaningful differences;  A master (class) with a marker (interface) can be instantiated but an abstract master can’t be. An abstract master can be considered as a guide. Or a template may be.  Since an abstract class is like a concrete class without the ability to be instantiated, a method can even an abstract method too. This is how the template pattern is implemented;1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738abstract class Oogway {  public abstract boolean साम();  public abstract boolean दाम();  public abstract boolean दन्ड();	public abstract boolean भेद​();  public boolean protectTheTemple() {    if(!साम() &amp;&amp; !दाम() &amp;&amp; !दन्ड() &amp;&amp; !भेद()); return false else return true;  }}abstract class Shifu extends Oogway {	public boolean साम(){		return true;	}  public abstract boolean दाम();  public boolean दन्ड(){	  return true;  }	public abstract boolean भेद​();}class TaiLung extends Shifu {	public boolean दाम(){		return true;	}	public boolean भेद​(){		return true;	}}public class BattelField{	public static void main(String[] args) {		Oogway fighter = new TaiLung();		System. out. println(fighter. protectTheTemple());	}}   In above example, I used unicode just for an example. But Java supports unicode in String value from Java 12. In other words, we can say that when Oogway can fight with the skills of Tai Lung, Oogway is abstract. Interface default methods: It doesn’t matter If there are 2 markers having a common method because the skill implemented by a master is supposed to be used further. But if more than 1 marker has a default method then the master can’t ignore it as it will create confusion. So the master is supposed to implement the skill otherwise the battle, I mean your application will not even start. 1234567891011121314151617interface PhonixFire {  public default void fly() {    System. out. println( I'm flying! );  }}interface EagalEye {  public default void fly() {    System. out. println( I fly high );  }}interface Po implements PhonixFire, EagalEye{  public default void fly() {    System. out. println( I afraid to fly but will learn to ride the weapon which can fly );  }}Remember that if Master Shifu is marked as Trainer, Po doesn’t become trainer automatically. Po also need to be marked as Trainer explicitly. Means Po needs to implement Trainer interface. Shadowing: In the last article, Master Shifu explained Po with the metaphor of lanterns that if a sub-type declares a variable with the same name his master used, then the value of sub-type will shadow the value of master. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132class Master{  final int x= 10;  static int y= 10;  int z= 10;}class Subtype extends Master{  int x= 20;  static int y= 20;  int z= 20;}public class Main {  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {        Master a = new Master();    System. out. println(a. x);//10    System. out. println(a. y);//10    System. out. println(a. z);//10       Subtype b = new Subtype();    System. out. println(b. x);//20    System. out. println(b. y);//20    System. out. println(b. z);//20       Master c = new Subtype();    System. out. println(c. x);//10    System. out. println(c. y);//10    System. out. println(c. z);//10  }}In Java, when a subclass declares a variable with the same name as a variable in its superclass, the subclass variable “hides” or shadows the superclass variable. This means that when accessing the variable through a reference of the superclass type, the superclass variable will be used, regardless of the actual object’s type. Dynamic method dispatch or late binding: But there is a twist; If you use a reference of the Master class but call a method of the Subtype class that uses the variables, the method will still use the variables of the Subtype class. This behavior is determined at runtime and is known as dynamic method dispatch or late binding. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031class Master {  final int x = 10;  static int y = 10;  int z = 10;    public void printVariables() {    System. out. println(x);    System. out. println(y);    System. out. println(z);  }}class Subtype extends Master {  int x = 20;  static int y = 20;  int z = 20;  @Override  public void printVariables() {    System. out. println(x);    System. out. println(y);    System. out. println(z);  }}public class Main {  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {    Master c = new Subtype();    c. printVariables(); // Calls the overridden method in Subtype  }}Output 123202020Note that we’re not using printVariables of Master class in above example but still declared it as we’re calling printVariables using the reference of Master class. Thought printVariables of Subtype would be called but if printVariables is not present in Master class then it’ll throw error at runtime: error: cannot find symbol.  📌 Info  When you use Master class as reference, all the methods and variables that you call via the reference variable must present in master class. Method Overriding and shadowing:  A static method can be shadowed by the subtype A final method can’t be overriden. Hence, gives error Normal methods are overriden by subtype1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526class Master {  static int m() {return 10;}   int m1() {return 10;}}class Subtype extends Master {  static int m() {return 20;}   int m1() {return 20;}}public class Main {  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {    Master a = new Master();    Subtype b = new Subtype();    Master c = new Subtype();    c. printVariables(); // Calls the method of Subtype class    System. out. println(a. m()); //10    System. out. println(b. m()); //20 //Shadowing    System. out. println(c. m()); //10     System. out. println(a. m1()); //10    System. out. println(b. m1()); //20 //Overriding    System. out. println(c. m1()); //20 //Overriding  }}I hope I have covered all the concepts.

    "title": "Story of Kungfu Java Valley",
    "body": "2023/06/24 - Once upon a time, in the mystical land of Java, there existed a wise and powerful creature known as Master Oogway. He was no ordinary being but an abstract class, revered as the commander and the master of all warriors, including Master Shifu. Each master possessed secret skills, represented by private skills and weapon, which were known only to them. However, there were certain skills that they were willing to share with those who aspired to follow in their footsteps. These special skills were protected and accessible only to their students. Master Oogway, being the epitome of tranquillity, held the private skill of attaining inner calm. In addition, he entrusted Master Shifu with a protected skill, teaching him the art of saving the temple from any threat. Under Master Oogway’s guidance, Master Shifu honed his abilities and trained diligently, preparing to face any challenges that came his way. Each master possessed secret skills that were passed down through generations.  Master Oogway, with his deep understanding of the universe, had mastered the art of harnessing the power of chi. This secret skill allowed him to achieve a state of calmness and centeredness, even in the face of adversity. He kept this skill private, sharing it only with his most trusted students. On the other hand, Master Shifu, a disciplined and dedicated student, had developed his own secret skill. He had mastered the art of using pressure points in combat, enabling him to defeat opponents with precision and efficiency. This skill was protected and passed down only to his most promising students. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526abstract class Oogway {  private String Calmness; //skill  private String SoloThought; //skill  protected String PhoenixBlade;	abstract public void fight();}class Shifu extends Oogway {	private List&lt;String&gt; pressurePoints;	public void fight(){		System. out. println( Defeat with:   + pressurePoints);	}	public void fight(String level){		if(level. equals( final )) System. out. println( Using protected weapon:   + PhoenixBlade);	}}public class Main {  public static void main(String[] args) {    Shifu shifu = new Shifu();    shifu. fight();    shifu. fight( final );  }}In their world, the masters possessed a unique magic that allowed them to create virtual images, or instances, of themselves. These images were sent into battle to protect the village and its inhabitants. Any villager in need could request the masters to create an image and accompany them in their quest to safeguard the village. However, Master Shifu possessed some static skills like the ability to open the gate of the temple effortlessly. He doesn’t need any of his images to do the same.  To prevent malevolent warriors, such as the infamous Kai, from harnessing their powers, both Master Oogway and Master Shifu sealed their skills securely. They were well aware of the potential dangers that could arise if their knowledge fell into the wrong hands. Additionally, both masters were marked as Temple Savers, an honorable position signifying their commitment to protecting the sacred grounds. 123456789101112131415sealed class Oogway permits Shifu {  // properties and methods of Oogway class}sealed class Shifu permits Po, Tigress {  // properties and methods of Shifu class}class Po extends Shifu {  // properties and methods of Po class}class Tigress extends Shifu {  // properties and methods of Tigress class}Every Monday, villagers flocked to the temple seeking the guidance and training of the masters. Regardless of who was present, any master bearing the Village Trainer interface was capable of providing instruction. The training modules implemented polymorphism, not concerning themselves with the specific identity of the master. As long as they possessed the necessary qualifications, any master could impart their wisdom. Just like polymorphism, allowed different masters to train the villagers or other master who is recognized as a trainee. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233abstract sealed class Oogway permits Shifu {  public void train() {    System. out. println( Oogway is training );  }}sealed class Shifu permits Po, Tigress implements Trainer{  public void train() {    System. out. println( Shifu is training );  }}interface Trainer {  default void train(Trainee trainee) {    trainee. train();  }}interface Trainee {}class Po extends Shifu implements Trainer, Trainee {}public class TrainingScheduler {	List&lt;Trainer&gt; trainers;	List&lt;Trainee&gt; trainees;	Map&lt;Trainer,Trainee&gt; schedule; 	public void schedule(){		//for each trainee in trainees		// pick a trainer from trainers randomly		// assign a trainer to trainee and save the schedule	}}One fateful day, a simple panda stumbled upon the temple. His eyes widened in awe as he spotted Master Shifu deep in meditation. The panda had long admired the master from afar and approached him with a humble request—to become a master like him. At first, Master Shifu hesitated, unsure if the panda had what it took to walk the path of a master. Yet, the panda’s unwavering determination and numerous attempts to convince him eventually persuaded Master Shifu to accept his request. He set one condition: the panda must become the final inheritor of his skills, unlike the non-sealed masters before him.  As the panda progressed in his training, he faced numerous challenges and obstacles. He had to prove his worthiness by going through intense combat sessions, mastering meditation techniques, and demonstrating his commitment to protecting the temple. Through his determination and hard work, the panda eventually became a master, inheriting the secret skills of Master Shifu.  Meanwhile, a powerful enemy threatened the village and the temple. The masters realized that they needed to train the villagers to defend themselves. The panda, now a master, took on the responsibility of training the villagers, using the skills he had learned from Master Shifu. The village united under the guidance of the masters and successfully defended their home. In the end, the temple remained a symbol of strength and resilience. The panda, now a respected master, continued to train future generations, passing down the ancient knowledge and skills that had been entrusted to him. This story showcases the importance of mentorship, dedication, and the power of perseverance. It highlights the concept of polymorphism, where different masters can train individuals as long as they possess the necessary skills and knowledge. It also emphasizes the significance of protecting valuable traditions and passing them down to future generations. ” As the panda continued his training under the guidance of Master Shifu, he learned about the concept of non-changeable skills and weapons, known as the final. His images can use them as it is. Even the maters of Panda type can’t change how those weapons work. With the permission of Master Shifu, Po finally removed the final from his type so he can make masters of his type. 1234567class Po extends Shifu {  final String secretSauce =  AX87DF89E3 ;  final void momoBlast() {    System. out. println( Fire the momo blast! );  }}During one eventful day, Master Shifu presented a final green-stone to the panda. This unique stone possessed a special power to freeze the enemy power for sometime. Intrigued, the panda decided to create a “green-stone” of his own to experiment and develop a new weapon similar to the one Master Shifu possessed. However, an unexpected interruption occurred when some villagers approached the panda, requesting his assistance in fighting against their enemies. Unfortunately, the panda forgot to remove the weapon he had recently created and inadvertently shared his image with the villagers.  Though villagers somehow won the fight, he got to know that “great-stone” didn’t work at all. He was surprised as Master Shifu himself showed his power to him. He went to Master Shifu to know why it failed in the war field. 1234567891011121314151617class Shifu {  //Uncomment any line you want, output will not change  protected final String greenStone =  green-stone ;  // protected String greenStone =  green-stone ;  // final String greenStone =  green-stone ;}class Po extends Shifu {  String greenStone =  po-green-stone ;}public class Main {  public static void main(String[] args) {    Po po = new Po();    System. out. println(po. greenStone); // po-green-stone  }}Master Shifu used a metaphor to explain this concept. He said, “Imagine that our final weapons are like two lanterns shining their light. When we have the same name for our weapons, it’s like placing one lantern directly in front of the other. The light from the first lantern will be hidden, and only the light from the second lantern will be visible. ”. He immediately realised his mistake of not erasing the weapon he created just for the experiment before making sharing his image with the villagers. Master Shifu advised the panda to choose a different name for his weapon to prevent any conflicts. He named it “light-green-stone”. Both clutched their stomachs and erupted in laughter, seemingly oblivious to anyone observing them.  No matter what speciality your master had. If you have something that your master also had, people will see you first. Because you’re concrete.  The Palace managed by Master Shifu can be considered as a Java microservice. It is the only palace on Jade Mountain and functions independently without being dependent on other temples. The Palace serves as a self-contained unit, providing specific services to its visitors. To manage the increasing workload of the Temple, a new library is created as a sub-unit or module within the Palace. The library operates as an independent entity, handling specific tasks and responsibilities. Despite being a part of the Temple, the library has its own separate functionality and can be accessed and utilized by villagers and another modules of the palace independently. In the context of Java, modules are a way to organize and encapsulate code. They allow for the separation of concerns and provide a modular structure to the application. Each module can have its own set of functionalities and dependencies. It provides a clear boundary for code ownership and enables different teams to work on different modules independently. A module can be considered as an independent microservice that is tightly coupled with a service but can work independently. A module can also be created when a micro-service is utilize the same resources and technology stack and has some meaning to be the part of same project.  ⚠️ Warning  In this article, inheritance is considered as a type relationship not as a “parent-child” relationship. Think in this way, Human class is inherited by Superman class. But Superman is not the child of the human but it is the type of Human. In the next article, I’ll explain to you all the Java concepts covered in this article. So bookmark this article.

    "title": "Fast XML Parser v4.2 Features",
    "body": "2023/04/09 - Fast XML Parser was initially developed to support npm package Stubmatic which is used for the rapid development of mock web services. Now Fast XML Parser has more than 9 million weekly downloads and approximately half a million projects on GitHub are using it including Microsoft, IBM, AWS, and many other big companies. In this post, we’ll talk about new features launched in V4. 1. 4 and v4. 2. 0  📌 Info  Use oneListGroup property to guide builder not to generate separate parent tag for each child of a list. Use updateTag method with parer to update attrbutes name, attributes values, and tag name. You can also skip a tag from parsing result. oneListGroup for XML builder: Ideally there is no group needed in XML for repetitive tags. But having it may make more sense to understand the data. 1234567891011121314151617Addresses: [  {    Address: {      line1:         line2:         line3:         city&gt;:       }  },{    Address: {      line1:         line2:         line3:         city&gt;:       }  }]XML Builder was previously enclosing each Address in Addresses tag separately before v4. 1. 4. Now, if you set oneListGroup: true as an option to Builder it makes only one group same as in the above JSON. 12345const builder = new XMLBuilder({    oneListGroup: true ,    format: true  });const result = builder. build(jObj);Output 1234567891011121314&lt;Addresses&gt;  &lt;Address&gt;    &lt;line1&gt;&lt;/line1&gt;    &lt;line2&gt;&lt;/line2&gt;    &lt;line3&gt;&lt;/line3&gt;    &lt;city&gt;&lt;/city&gt;  &lt;/Address&gt;  &lt;Address&gt;    &lt;line1&gt;&lt;/line1&gt;    &lt;line2&gt;&lt;/line2&gt;    &lt;line3&gt;&lt;/line3&gt;    &lt;city&gt;&lt;/city&gt;  &lt;/Address&gt;&lt;/Addresses&gt;Change Attributes:     Note: This feature is currently added to the XML parser only. Sometimes incoming XML doesn’t fit to our expectations. We may want to skip a few attributes of a tag from the parsing result. Sometimes we want to aggregate all the attributes in one or just change the value or name of some attributes. updateTag method in parser’s option gives the independency to manage attributes in your way. Input 1234567&lt;root&gt;  &lt;a keep= me  skip= me &gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a skip= me &gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a need= friend &gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a camel= case  MakeMe= lower &gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;b change= val &gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/root&gt;Code 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425const options = {  attributeNamePrefix:   ,  ignoreAttributes:  false,  updateTag(tagName, jPath, attrs){    if(attrs[ skip ]) delete attrs[ skip ]    if(attrs[ camel ]) {      attrs[ Camel ] = attrs[ camel ];      delete attrs[ camel ];    }    if(attrs[ need ]) {      attrs[ friend ] =  me ;    }    if(attrs[ MakeMe ]) {      attrs[ makeme ] = attrs[ MakeMe ];      delete attrs[ MakeMe ];    }    if(attrs[ change ]) {      attrs[ change ] = attrs[ change ]. toUpperCase();    }    return tagName;  }};const parser = new XMLParser(options);let result = parser. parse(xmlData);Output 123456789101112131415161718192021{   root : {     a : [      {         keep :  me       },        ,      {         need :  friend ,         friend :  me       },      {         Camel :  case ,         makeme :  lower       }    ],     b : {       change :  VAL     }  }}    Note: Please remember that `ignoreAttributes: false` is setChange Tag name or skip a tag: Though updateTag doesn’t give you full control to manage tag but you can change tag name or skip a tag from the parsing result. Suppose, you’re parsing a HTML document and want to skip all the script tags or you want to change the name of a tag when it is not properly formatted. You may also conditionally skip a tag like to skip img tag for big images.

    "title": "Make a Better SEO URL",
    "body": "2023/04/01 - URLs are an important factor in SEO, but many websites fall short when it comes to optimizing them for search engines. This post will explain all the variables that can affect your site’s searchability as a result of a poor URL.    No Special Characters: Processing issues can arise when a URL contains special characters or Unicode other than numerals, English alphabets, and hyphens. Because an emoji can be used in many different contexts and cannot be typed from a keyboard, a URL containing one may not appear in search engine results. Any other character which has no textual sense but is used to just decorate a post title, like [,],(,) should be avoided. Characters like @, #, &amp;, ` `(space) can cause issues to interpret a URL.     Don’t change it: We improve post contents multiple times to make them updated with the latest information or to correct errors. It may lead to a change in the post title hence the URL. If a post URL is very specific, it is a higher chance to get modified in the future. For instance, if you write about “Top 3 Sites for Typography” and found a more after few months then you may want to update the same article than write a new one. The title may change to “Top 4 sites for Typography”.   URLs can be bookmarked in browsers, cached by search engines, and referred by other sites. Sometimes you even share it on social media platforms. If the URL gets changed, it’ll result in broken links.    All hates long URL: Whether it is a search engine or a social media platform, all shorten the long URLs. Either they are replaced with another URL with some random string or cut some part to make them unreadable.     Dates can make your post old: Once you publish an article with the date in URLs, you don’t change the publish date when you update the content. Otherwise, any change in the URL will result in broken links. Many of us used to search for the latest content. So the URLs with older dates are automatically filtered out even if they’re recently updated.    Post URL ≠ Post Title: An attractive post title may increase traffic to the site. But a post URL is just a link referred by search engines and other sites. It should be short with necessary SEO friendly keywords without page extensions or propositions.      Post URL ≠ Post Title      Hierarchy: It’s difficult to manage if all the posts are stored in the top folder of a blog, especially for static sites. On the other hand, it is also not a good practice if they’re deeply nested.   https://solothought. com/tutorials/make-better-seo-url  https://solothought. com/tutorials/Web/SEO/make-better-seo-url  https://solothought. com/tutorials/make-better-seo-url  You can control it by setting paramlink in jekyll, wordpress, or other frameworks.  Spam Words: URLs having keywords related to money, deals, freebies, and offers Or the URL who are creating urgency or pressure, are generally considered spam. Many search engines filter out such URLs.   https://solothought. com/a-free-tip-for-seo-url  https://solothought. com/an-urgent-advice-for-seo-url  https://solothought. com/free-copy-of-premium-ebook-on-seo-urls  "
